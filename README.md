# MMC-check-in
A web application using Parse to check in to lessons as a MMC instructor

It will allow our board to easily see who has actually showed up to 
their lessons for the week, without the hassle of maintaining paper
sign-ins.

So far, I have completed the Parse framework as well as the
initial login and sign up pages.

To complete: the check-in process
